# ðŸ©º Doctorâ€™s Dilemma: Predicting the Right Prescription with a `Decision Tree`

Welcome to **Doctorâ€™s Dilemma**, a machine learning project where you take on the role of a data-driven doctor. Using patient data â€” including **Age**, **Sex**, **Blood Pressure**, and **Cholesterol** â€” this notebook trains a model to predict which of five drugs (**Drug A, B, C, X, or Y**) should be prescribed.

## ðŸ§  Problem Type
**Multiclass Classification**  
Predict the most suitable medication based on patient features.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `doctors_dilemma.ipynb` â€” Jupyter notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `drugs200.csv` â€” (Data) CSV file of the patients info. These are some dummy data, but resemebles real data.
- `requirements.txt` â€” Package dependencies to reproduce the environment.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make sure your environment includes:
   - Python 3.x
   - numpy==2.2.0  
   - pandas==2.2.3  
   - scikit-learn==1.6.0
